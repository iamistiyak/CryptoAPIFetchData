**Run this command in the ACP before create the jupyter notebook**<br>
**Anaconda command prompt:** 
jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=10000000000

It will increase the limit of the data fetching in the jupyter nootebook.


**I have uploaded 3 files, among of these 2 of them are jupyter notebook and a csv file which store the data**
